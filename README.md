## General Overview of the Project
I used TypeScript for type safety purposes. I made the most of SSR (Server-Side Rendering). Since it was a single-page task, I didn't see the need for state management. Responsive design was achieved with Tailwind. I tested the responsiveness of the design on iPhone, Samsung, and iPad, and there were no issues. I tried to write code as simply as possible without complicating it too much. Due to it being a single page, there was no need to use useParams and dynamic files; I only used useRouter in the search box component. I attempted to utilize all the given data and assets. Since I put the code up without testing, I can't provide any concrete information regarding UX/UI or performance issues.
